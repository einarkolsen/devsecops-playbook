# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

This site currently runs on [Netlify](https://devsecops-telia.netlify.app/) and is automatically deployed upon push to master. 

### Contriute
Anybody can contribute to the project. You can do so ether by:

* checking out the repo, do changes locally and push to the master branch, or
* edit files directly on the gihub website (there is a link on this website)
